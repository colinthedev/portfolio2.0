# Personal Portfolio :partying_face:

**Version 2.0** <br>

## About :point_down:

The purpose for this project is to showcase my latest featured projects and *current* skillset. 
<br>
<br>
This project was created from scratch using grid for the main layout and **BEM** method.
>
Deployed using Netlify.


## Design :paintbrush: 

I used **figma** to create the design and **photoshop** for some photo edits. 
<br>
<br>
There were **4** other portfolio designs before this one that i had made using figma. With every other design something just didnt seem quite right with it...Until this one!
<br>
<br>
Although this ended up as the *5th* design in the process of making this portfolio, i found that by the end of the finished product i had incorporated components from the other 4 designs into the final one.

### Created by me using figma:

- **Flamingo** :flamingo:
  - **Lightbulb** :bulb:
    - **Octopus** :octopus:

## Final Considerations

This project was great practice putting some of my javascript knowledge through the ringer! :boxing_glove: 
<br>
<br>
*Their are some areas which can be refactored and look forward to returning to do so in the future.*
<br>
<br>
This was also my first time using [ScrollMagic](https://scrollmagic.io/)
