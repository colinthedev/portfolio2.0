# Personal Portfolio

**Version 2.0**

## About

The purpose for this project is to showcase my latest featured projects and *current* skillset._There were **4** other portfolio designs before this one that i had made using figma. With every other design something just didnt seem quite right with it...Until this one!

## Design

I used **figma** to create the design and **photoshop** for some photo edits._Although this ended up as the *5th* design in the process of making this portfolio, i found that by the end of the finished product i had incorporated components from the other 4 designs into the final one.

#### Created by me using figma:

- **Flamingo**
  - **Lightbulb**
    - **Octopus**
