## About :point_down:

The purpose for this project is to showcase my latest featured projects and *current* skillset. 
<br>
<br>
This project was created from scratch using grid for the main layout and **BEM** method.

Deployed using Netlify.


## Design :paintbrush: 

I used **figma** to create the design and **photoshop** for some photo edits. 
<br>
<br>
There were **4** other portfolio designs before this one that i had made using figma.

By the end of the finished product i had incorporated components from the other 4 designs into the final one.
